# Step 1: Collect Data
# You can get historical NCAA basketball data from websites like Kaggle or NCAA's official website

# Step 2: Preprocess Data
# Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, normalize features, etc.

# Step 3: Feature Selection/Engineering
# Select relevant features that are likely to influence game outcomes

# Step 4: Model Selection
# model = LogisticRegression()

# Step 5: Train Model
# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Evaluate Model
# y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
# accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
# print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Step 7: Make Predictions
# Use trained model to predict outcomes of tournament games

# Step 8: Generate Bracket
# Generate your bracket based on predictions

# Step 9: Submit Bracket
# Submit your bracket for the competition
